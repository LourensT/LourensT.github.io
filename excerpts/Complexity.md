    <p> [...] Dat hadden ze allemaal al zo vaak van hem gehoord. En alles wat hij zei: bijvoorbeeld dat er gewacht moest worden tot er weer proviand was, of dat de manschappen geen laarzen hadden, was zo simpel en alles wat zij voorstelden was zo ingewikkeld en geleerd, dat het voor hen een uitgemaakte zaak was dat Koetoezov een domme oude man was, en dat zijzelf geniale veldheren waren die het alleen aan macht ontbrak. </p>

And a translation to English.
<blockquote>
<p>[...] They had all heard that from him so often already. And everything he said: for example, that they should wait until there was food again, or that the troops had no boots, was so simple, and everything they proposed was so complicated and learned, that for them it was an established fact that Kutuzov was a stupid old man, and that they themselves were brilliant generals who only lacked power.</p>

For all my gripes with War and Peace, it is so full of these little timeless paragraphs. The hubris of the studied generals, military theory at the ready, ignoring the mundane practicalities of running the army. Their frustration with the unassuming, aging general Kutuzov, who does not pretend to entertain their careful strategy. Not dissimilar to your McKinseyian management whoneed to be grounded by the practical folk. 

Simplicity above complexity. A heuristic that goes a long way. Can you explain something in simple terms? Then you understand it. Do you know someone who cannot explain their expertise in simple terms, then they are no experts. But a heuristic and nothing more. Your own simple explanations might hide your comfort with the subject. I recall studying a particular unintuitive piece of mathematics. Finally, after many hours ploughing through the material, building and dismantling the logical structure time and time again, the neural pathways had crystallized and I was able to quickly associate the objects, to see the true statements as simple. But I fooled myself with this "simplicity". Excitingly, I rattled off my simple insights to a friend, who looked at me with glassy eyes. 

I suppose if the roles were reversed, I would have silently criticized my friend: surely he could've have put it in simpler terms? He must not understand it as well as he thinks. But I sincerely think I did. Any metaphor would've been kin to misleading. 

So how then in the theory on war? Unlike the truthful, ever so arrogant, field of mathematics, the "soft" sciences like waging war are not subject to a natural selection of elegance. Where in math, obfuscation through complexity is punished by an inability to find new things that are provably true, in the theory of war there is no such reckoning. Neither is there in business. There will always be a reason among the complexity that explain a failure, except the theory itself. And it goes without saying that any victory will be claimed by the same theory. Pragmatism is not a thankful job.
