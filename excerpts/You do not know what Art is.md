    <p> The creation of wealth is certainly not to be despised, but in the long run the only human activities really worthwile are the search for knowledge, and the creation of beauty. This is beyond argument; the only point of debate is which comes first. </p>

If the debate is between knowledge and beauty above all, where would you side? The comparison between art and science is often made, but the connection is not always clear to me. A friend of mine expressed frustration that she could never be an artist because she does not understand what art is. I disagreed with that perspective, and we came to realize that if anything, this highlights a similarity between art and science: an artist exists exactly because we do not know what art is. Every piece of art is, in a sense, an exploration of what art can be. Similarly, would there be physicists if we would know all of physics?Â  

The question which comes first, beauty or knowledge, is left undecided for me. Maybe the entire question is irrelevant, as we see knowledge in beauty and beauty in knowledge. 

The book this excerpt is from, Profiles of the Future by Arthur Clarke, is fascinating. A renowned science fiction author attempting to predict the future in the 60's. He willingly admitted history will prove him wrong, but 50 years later, he made some stunningly accurate predictions (and some entertaining misses).
