Two days ago, the first war on the European continent since WWII started, with Russia invading Ukraine. There is plenty to be said about this conflict, its causes and implications. In our times of nuanced discussion, I saw insistence to frame this as "Putin's War" vs "Russia's War".  Whether this is fair or not, it poses the interesting question of... why? 

Broadly speaking, there are two reasons for Putin initiating this invasion. He was forced to, or he wanted to. The former is often downplayed, partly because a dictator's image of holding sole power is so successful.  But it is perfectly possible that, because of reasons we cannot know exactly, Putin had to invade Ukraine to consolidate any reasonable level of power. For example, an influential oligarch wanting to undermine Ukrainian competition, leadership in the army that is scared of losing influence, or whatever.  There is the stance that it was the only reasonable action after NATO expansion, although I disagree, NATO poses no *immediate nor complete* risk to Putin's personal position of power. Putin could continue to maintain his power (to a high degree) for the foreseeable future.  

At this point, most people will disagree with me. Obviously, they say, Putin is not satisfied with his current position.  He seeks monetary gain! Hit him where it hurts, sanctions galore. And if not that, he wants *power*. Nietzsche has said it, and we are willing to pin this leading motive on Putin: a *Will to Power*.  

Coincidentally, I read over this quote.  Does passion offer an alternative motive from will to power? They are not the same thing.  Passion, in its core, is the love for the activity. You have passion for playing basketball, not for winning championships, even if the former leads to the latter. Power is the result of (successful) war.  Is it possible that Putin is not motivated by power but just has a passion for land grabs?  Even if that land grab destroyed the prosperity of his people, and eventually the wealth of himself. "*They would follow \[passion\] again, into death for themselves and everybody around them if that was where it led.*" It's a chilling thought, because it shuts out many of the options of deterrence we have.  Only one thing persists: beating him at the game itself.
