<blockquote>
    <p> One thing that favoured the establishment of the constitution in America was that the different States, still young and little accustomed to independence, had not yet cherished to a high degree that individual pride and those national prejudices which make it so painful for old societies to give up the smallest parts of their sovereignty. Examples of federal unions in antiquity and in modern history: 
	<ol>
		<li>
    The Amphictyonic council. 
		</li>
		<li>
    The Achaean league. 
		</li>
		<li>
    The Germanic body. [i.e. Holy Roman Empire.] 
		</li>
		<li>
    United Provinces of the Low Countries. 
		</li>
		<li>
    Switzerland. 
		</li>
	</ol>
	All these confederations have suffered from the defect of the first American Union; they did not at all make a single people out of the different provinces united by establishing a central power and sovereignty in matters that concerned the union. They all came to suffer from civil war, or disintegration and anarchy, but none of them was sufficiently enlightened, as was the American Union, to see the remedy at the same time as it felt the ill and to correct its laws.</p>

Alexis de Tocqueville travelled through North America as a young bloke, and I got my hands on this relatively obscure English translation of his notes of that time. They contain a poorly organized heap of first impressions about the fledgling country, many conversations with its citizens and some analysis. I am assuming that during this time he felt the spirit underlying the topic of his seminal work "Democracy in America", published four years later, but I haven't read it. 

This excerpt is not very representative of the rest of the notes (which are predominantly about the penal system, Common Law, slavery, the Native Americans, French Canada, etcetera). Still, a timeless observation: Tocqueville recognizes how the federal government has started directing its attention to all American individuals in the states, instead of the states as entities themselves. This makes the American people. The Netherlands gets a little shout-out here, but buy now our provinces have effectively fused together (although you'd be surprised by the amount of Provincial identity). 

Of course, there is a union that did not exist in Alexis' time, a union of which the necessity of its flourishing I am more convinced than ever. The EU, like these other five unions "suffers from the defect of the first American Union", as it has "not at all made a single people out of its \[member states\]". And although European elections go straight to the people, its laws are aimed at the national governments. And so suffers the EU from the thousand cuts an unwilling member state can inflict. A worrying state of affairs, especially with the tough times ahead. 

Much of the legislation (read: regulation) the EU speaks into existence does not concern the individual, and it could not as it deals with government entities and firms. Individuals can sue their governments when they feel that they are not adhering to their European duties. Could you however imagine an EU-wide tax agency, Ã  la IRS? No, you cannot. But similarly, could you imagine USA with anywhere near the same power, if it was lacking federal tax collection?

For all its flaws, I support further European integration.
