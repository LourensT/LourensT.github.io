<blockquote>
    <p>  He dragged on his cigar. 'God damn it' he said, 'there are nice things in the world – and I mean nice things. We're all such morons to get so sidetracked. Always, always, always referring every goddam thing that happens right back to our lousy little egos.' Behind him, just then, Franny blew her nose with guileless abandon; the report was considerably louder than might have been expected from so fine and delicate-appearing an organ. Zooey turned around to look at her, somewhat censoriously. </p>

The second Salinger excerpt. Zooey, in the middle of a heart-to-heart with his younger sister Franny, sees from the window of their Manhattan apartment a little scene with a girl and her Dachsund. Then, the self-assured bluntness of the ego denouncing ego. We, the readers, have by now been consuming Zooey's erratic speech for a couple pages, and it is rightfully disturbed by Franny—who I imagine is thoroughly desensitized to these performances her brother puts on. 
	
Salinger does some of the finest mocking of intellectuals. Franny & Zooey are the youngest of seven siblings that all starred on a radioshow called *It's a Wise Child*. The two oldest brothers take it upon themselves to give F & Z an alternative, but extremely thorough philosophical/spiritual education. These so-created "freaks" of erudition are the platform the story uses to criticize the phonies, coming from a place of intellectual superiority. 

This would all be awfully pretentious if the writing wasn't dripping in irony. Every brainy remark is followed by some observation on the gawky interactions between these characters. It puts on display how unbearable it has made them. And how they're lost amidst all their supposed wisdom.

A closing remark: I wonder if I have ever looked "censoriously" at someone. I can only think of a couple people in my life that would be capable of the expression. An aspiration.
