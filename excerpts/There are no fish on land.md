Something that has been on my mind recently, is the relationship between humanity and nature. In the following, let me define nature as everything that is alive. And so far, that means all of nature is contained on this earth (discovery of alien life will shake up so many of our tidy definitions, and  probably more). This definition is in contrast with the broader universe. So the moon, the sun, the galaxy are not part of nature, but every organism you know, is. 

There is an environmentalist mentality of wanting to be "in harmony with nature", which has always rubbed me the wrong way. It is true that we are part of nature, and that we are dependent on a lot of different life-forms. It is also true that we are in many ways not harmonious with nature. Just look at the rate of which species are going extinct and how humanity changes the face of the earth in favor of lifeless structures.

This leads to the comforting idea of striving for harmony with nature. A mindset which solves our destructive tendencies, and unites us with that from which we've emerged. What bothers me, is that this is a view which looks at the past, but not at the future.

That is because above all, we are separating ourselves from nature more and more. The excerpt states that if we truly enter space, do we cease to be human? As humanity advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to relate ourselves to nature. There is no question that we originate from nature, but as we eliminate most health issues, engineer intelligence, maintain artificial ecosystems, and leave the earth behind us, we will ultimately place ourselves above nature. A belief which is reliant on viewing us as living alongside nature is unsustainable.

If we are striving for a long-lasting mentality with nature, because there is no doubt nature holds incredible value and beauty, we should not focus on our relationship to it. Instead, we should focus on its inherent qualities, the diversity, the ingenuity, the unbelievability. The more we appreciate what we can learn and enjoy from nature, the less likely we are to let it go to waste. The new frontier of space is alluring, but we should not risk forgetting what we find here. Space-exploration critics will assert that there is so much to appreciate here on earth, and I have to agree with them (not with their conclusion that this is mutually exclusive with exploring space).

A clear criticism of this view, of appreciating nature from the outside, without acknowledging our unity with it, is the arrogance we emit. Humanity breathes the oxygen our plants and algae produce, the microbes on our skin and in our stomachs sustains us. We are in almost every way very dependent on the life around us. With the climate crisis ominously approaching it seems na√Øve to declare that we should not harmonize with nature. In a sense, this is a strong pragmatic argument. We should strive to harmonize with nature, to save our livelihood.

I do wonder, if we prioritize pragmatism of idealism, does focusing on harmony make sense? An alternative, a rhetoric focused on the existential threat, seems more effective. As I am sitting in my concrete cube in the middle of a mostly concrete city, losing species and biodiversity is tragic, but not being able to buy food is terrifying. 

The view of humanity being in harmony with nature is one founded in the past, but not applicable to the future. Some day, we will leave our roots behind, and an alternative appreciation of nature is needed. One focused on its inherent quality is necessary to prevent nature from going to waste.
