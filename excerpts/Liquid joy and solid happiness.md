I have, as of yet, not frauded myself into a teaching position at any new-fledged art schools in Montreal, as John "De Daumier" Smith, does in this short story by JDS. I did however find myself in Canada too recently, albeit under a different pretense. Naturally, as someone who has the futile habit of trying to understand the effect of their environment on their inner, I stuck.

In the last chapter of "Thinking, Fast and Slow" (if I remember correctly) is about measuring happiness, and the effect of major life events on a person's happiness. One of the conclusions drawn is that achievements (i.e. educational attainment, income after a certain threshold, marriage, having kids, great friendships) have little effect on your day-to-day experience. Something minor, like a headache, will overrule any long term mood enhancement from these milestones. In fact the kids, probably because they cause headaches, have a net-negative on day-to-day enjoyment for the first 18 years. But these achievements do increase your end-of-day enjoyment: how you feel about your life when you sit on the couch and ponder (I don't know what term is used in the book and I am not going to look it up).

Every day, a stream of joy glistens in the sun, and pleasantly cools your legs and hands when you step in and reach down. Some days, the stream is weak, almost barren. On other days, it is lush, refreshing, energizing. I have spent a long time mining and carrying slabs of happiness to this stream, cornering off a small little pond. When the stream stops, I can sit and enjoy the water that has built up. 

My little dam I had to leave behind when I came here. Most of it: some of the slabs I could fit in my carry-on. Now, I'm trying my best to build a new pond: there sure is enough water coming by. And on the days where I miss my old pond, I  cherish the thought that at some point, I'll be back, hopefully bringing some more slabs, of a new shape and material.
