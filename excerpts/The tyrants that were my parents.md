As we get older, the way we look at our parents changes. Shortly after puberty, when your, once-volatile, inner voice stops fluctuating year-to-year, and your ego stabilizes, your parents still have a responsibility over you. At that point in time, you experience this as a limitation to your freedom. Because of the power imbalance in this period of life, we rarely look at our parents as equals. Instead, we view them, at least implicitly, as the banal tyrants. We view ourselves as unjustly subjected, constrained in our potential, a potential our parents have never known. The realization of equality comes when we are older. We return home,  as independent beings, and our parents become people in our life, instead of merely decision-makers. 

This made me acknowledge for the first time, the similarities between me and my dad. He and I share interests and tendencies. And above all, the fact we are both human. (He shares the place of being the most similar human to me genetically with my mom and brother). 

As my dad gets older, as his age starts to show, as I reach adulthood, it is clear that my dad is the closest thing I have to a time-capsule from the future. The fallibility of my father becomes the greatest counterexample to my thoughts that the rules don't apply to me. Yes, I know humans are mortal and life must come to an end, but these human are not *like me*. Only I am the one that thinks in my head, so who is to say that l am not the exception to the inevitable? Well, my father, my equal, has to face the inevitable. So do I.

Aside from being the moist poignant reminder of the finiteness of life, my parents are constants. They give purpose to my accomplishments. In these formative years of my life, it is not yet clear who will be the constants in the rest of my life. I have thought I knew who were, only to be painfully wrong. Both my mom and dad are still in good health, and they will probably be around for a long time. The reminder that their existence is not guaranteed, is a reminder that the foundations of life are fickle.
