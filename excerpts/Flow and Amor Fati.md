Current pandemic situation has stripped daily routines to only their core activity. Some have become better this way, some have become worse. Watching lectures has become one of the most draining things for me, as with distraction one click away, and only a poor quality recording to keep my attention, there is little flow to be found. Flow is characterized by a good match between challenge and skills, combined with instant feedback. In the first respect, lectures fail often: they are either to easy, leading to boredom in the moment, or they are overwhelming, leading to anxiety in the moment.  In this case, there is little to be done, getting into a state of flow is basically impossible. At the same time, finding a way to better the experience in activities like these lectures, would make for a significant better quality of life. Maybe that is why the following paragraph, describing Nietzsche's amor fati, speaks to me especially.

<blockquote>
    <p>  This attitude toward one's choices is well expressed in the concept of amor fati-or love of fate-a central concept in Nietzsche's philosophy. For instance, in discussing what it takes to live fully, he writes: "My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity... Not merely bear what is necessary... but love it." And: "I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful." </p>
